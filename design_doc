Players start with N rovers on a large grid map.
The aim of the game is to write a program to move the rovers over the map, coloring tiles to your color.

Win conditions could be:
	Most tiles owned in a time limit
	Own all the tiles
	Destroy all the enemy rovers

Rovers can move over tiles, and may change the color of tile they are on to own the tile.
Changing the color of tiles owned by the enemy takes longer. First the tile must be changed to neutral, then to the players color.
Rovers can attack enemy rovers
Rovers get a speed and defensive bonus when on their own color
Rovers can only attack one target at a time
Rovers get a speed and defensive penalty when on an enemies color
